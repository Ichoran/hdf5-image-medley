# hdf5-image-medley/R

## About

There is R support for HDF5 in the [h5](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/h5/index.html)
package available on CRAN.

There is also a non-CRAN [rhdf5 package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rhdf5.html).

HDF5 image support is likely to be viable with R.
