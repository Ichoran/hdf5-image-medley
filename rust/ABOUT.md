# hdf5-image-medley/rust

## About

HDF5 wrappers for Rust are available in
[hdf5-rs](https://github.com/aldanor/hdf5-rs) and also
[hdf5](https://github.com/stainless-steel/hdf5).  (There is a third HDF5
project that appears incomplete and not under active development, which is
not linked here.)

It is not clear which is better, but it is likely that HDF5 image support
in Rust is viable.
