#ABOUT
MATLAB includes full support for the whole hdf5 library. The current library [h5* functions](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/hdf5-files.html?refresh=true) was introduced in the version R2011a. However, there was support for hdf5 before R2006a using the [hdf5* functions](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hdf5read.html). The old libraries are slow and are going to be remove in future versions, therefore they should be avoided if possible.

As a last comment from R2006b the .mat files are internally stored as hdf5 (http://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/mat-file-versions.html).
