## About

National Instruments does not provide complete HDF5 support, though they
do use it as a storage format for some of their products.

The most complete HDF5 library appears to be
[Live HDF5 from UPVI](http://www.upvi.net/main/index.php/products/lvhdf5).
It is "free of charge to most users".

Thus, HDF5 support in LabVIEW appears possible.
